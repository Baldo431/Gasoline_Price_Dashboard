396,@WhiteHouse I‚Äôm rather positive this is a lie. Gas prices were higher prior to the Fighting because of your instant attack on the US oil production and oil corp greed.
397,@mpukita Oil meant for crisis like wars is not meant to ease the cost of gas. War won't happen until it does. We will be defenseless against a country that produces their own energy like we used to do. Producing a surplus of energy shows our might to the world and is a deterrent to war.
