# **Gasoline Price Predictor**

## **Overview**

<br>

### About
In todayâ€™s modern world, fuel is an essential part of everyday life. It helps us get to work on time, receive packages when we order products online, fuels some of the machinery that helps grow our food, and does so many more things. However, in recent events, the price of fuel has seen significant fluctuation causing worries in the average American as the price begins to take a chunk out of their wallet. Therefore, the goal of this project is to create a dashboard hosted on a webpage that will provide users with fuel related information to help them make better informed decisions.

### Communication Protocols

Tools: 
- Slack for instant messaging (IM).
- Zoom for audio and video communication.
- Google Drive and its ecosystem for document collaboration outside of Github.
- Github for code managment.

Protocols:
- Bi-weekly meetup for project progress check-up. Scheduled during class time.
- Assistance outside of meeting times is directed through IM on Slack. Further assistance may be requested through a Zoom meeting as needed.
- Main branch merges require review by other team members. The reviews may be conducted through Slack IM, Github review process, or on a Zoom meeting. 

## Scraping Twitter
Twitter is an American social networking service where individuals can microblog in a form of "Tweet". There are many limitations of accessing Twitter. Twitter's API allows access to recent data up to a week old and retrieve 500,000 Tweets per month. We will be scraping all Tweets that include the words: "gas" and "oil".

#### The Process
To scrape the data from Twitter, we created a Twitter account and applied to access the API. Once we got accepted, we used the API key to connect to Twitter. We were able to collect the number of Tweets and all Tweets that included the words: "gas" and "oil" from the past seven days.

#### Limitations
In order to grab data longer than seven days from Twitter, we scraped new Tweets every day and added it to the previous combined data (`tweets.csv` and `tweet_count.csv`).


## Machine Learning

<br>

### Linear Regression (see gas_oil_ML.ipynb)
#### Description of Preliminary Data Preprocessing
Starting with crude oil data (1983 to present) and gas and diesel price data (1995 to 2021), the data are cleaned to fit into a linear regression machine learning model.
The data are loaded into two dataframes (gas_df and crude_df). The cleaned gas price dataframe includes all formulations of retail gasoline and diesel prices in a MM/DD/YYYY format with samples from each month starting in January 1995 to January 2021. The cleaned crude oil dataframe is in the same format as the cleaned gas price dataframe: MM/DD/YYYY format with monthly samples from January 1995 to January 2021.
#### Description of Preliminary Feature Engineering and Preliminary Feature Selection
To fit a linear regression model with crude oil and gas price data to establish and explore relationships between the data.
#### Explanation of Model Choice, including Limitations and Benefits 
This linear regression model is the best model because historically, crude oil prices and gas prices have a linear relationship, so there is no need to complicate the relationship with other, more complex models.
#### Train, Test, Split Description 
The data are split into 80% training and 20% testing.

### Natural Language Processsing (Sentiment Analysis) (see twitter_NLP.ipynb)
#### Description of Preliminary Data Preprocessing
Using tweets from November 2022 to present, the data are cleaned and subjectivity and polarity score columns are included.
#### Description of Preliminary Feature Engineering and Preliminary Feature Selection
To use natural language processing to characterize the sentiment of current tweets on gas prices (positive, neutral, or negative sentiment).
#### Explanation of Model Choice, including Limitations and Benefits 
This sentiment analysis NLP model is useful to understand consumers' feedback and their needs. A, perhaps, better NLP model would be a BERT model. A BERT model has two tasks: language modeling and next sentence prediction, which is better for the context of tweets, rather than a simple positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.
#### Train, Test, Split Description 
The data are split into 80% training and 20% testing.
